Online Card Game Engine
=======================

Attempt at making an engine for playing card games (not like poker, think more Cards Against Humaity) online with real time multiplayer.

Loads of these kinds of sites exist but making an engine open source will hopefully make even more people able to make their game ideas real.  Especially me.  Mostly me for now, actually.

Hopefully will someday be more of an editor usable my anyone than just open source code.
